# Prerequisites

To run `wasm-pack` you'll need to have both Rust and npm installed and configured.

- [Rust](/wasm-pack/book/prerequisites/rust.html)
- [npm](/wasm-pack/book/prerequisites/npm.html)

In the future, we intend to rewrite the npm registry client bits so that the need
for a Node runtime is eliminated. If you're excited about that work- you should
reach out to the maintainers and get involved!
